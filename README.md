# LamAPI
This repo contains our school's project aiming to build a Web service that compute GeoPose from user's infos

## lamar-benchmark

We provide a docker subdirectory with the dockerfile from lamar-benchmark and a README ['How to set-up server?'](docker/DOCKER.md) to set-up the server from distant image (that's the better solution for installation stability).
